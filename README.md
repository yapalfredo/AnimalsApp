# AnimalsApp
State of the Art Android app development in Java (Course Repo)

This app was created from following a course I bought from Udemy.

It uses a RecyclerView and implemeted a Grid inside of it with 2 divisons per row. It fetch the content from a remote JSON file and converts the data to a readable object and displays the fetched data to the app.

The App has 2 fragments; the first one wholds the list of animals from the main layout and the second one fires up to display the animal details specific to the animal you tapped/clicked from the first fragment.
